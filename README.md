# Dart_x01_Score

Project Overview
This project is a combination and practices everything I learned in section #3 of the Nanodegree program. I made an app that allows a user to keep track of points within a game.

The goal was to create a Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different players for Darts game (101 - 901). 
To build this project, I followed along with the practice set and customized the Court Counter app to track scores from a different sport.
