# Dart_x01_Score

Project Overview
This project is a combination and practices everything I learned in section #3 of the Nanodegree program. I made an app that allows a user to keep track of points within a game.

The goal was to create a Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different players for Darts game (101 - 901). 
To build this project, I followed along with the practice set and customized the Court Counter app to track scores from a different sport.

## How to play

Each player starts with a score of 101 or 201 or 501 or 301... whatever you like. And takes turns to throw 3 darts. 
The score for each turn is calculated and deducted from the player's total. 

### Scores:
Bull's Eye scores 50.
The outer ring scores 25.
A dart in the double or triple ring counts double or triple the segment score.

### For each player do:
1. Select the game by '-' and '+' buttons (e.g. 301).
2. Player A throws 3 darts and inputs scores for each accomplished target into fields 1, 2 and 3. If missed, you can input digit zero or tap on the 'MISS' button under the according to throw field.
3. Tap on the 'CALCULATE' button. You will see the Current score of the Player and how many Throws left (Total throws are limited to 54. It is shown as a decreasing number for each player in the upper right corner).
4. If the Player wins, you will see Congrats' message. Game is over.
5. Now you can reset all Scores and Throws for both Players by 'RESET' button.
HAPPY DARTING!
