# Dart_x01_Score

Project Overview
This project is a combination and practices everything I learned in section #3 of the Nanodegree program. I made an app that allows a user to keep track of points within a game.

The goal was to create a Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different players for Darts game (101 - 901). 
To build this project, I followed along with the practice set and customized the Court Counter app to track scores from a different sport.

## How to play

Each player starts with a score of 101 or 201 or 501 or 301... whatever you like. And takes turns to throw 3 darts. 
The score for each turn is calculated and deducted from the players total. Bullseye scores 50, the outer ring scores 25 and a dart in the double or triple ring counts double or triple the segment score.
